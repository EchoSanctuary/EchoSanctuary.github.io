            In order to give you the most value, I must write and think relentlessly. This work cannot always be synthesized into short posts or quotes, so I am offering you the only philosophical newsletter you will ever need.
                <br>
                <br>
            In this way, I always have contact with you - the reader - in case anything happens to my platforms. What I preach can be deemed as dangerous at any moment. Remember that our modern society does not want you to deconstruct their ways of running the world. They know that their ways are malicious, and I am here to provide an alternative to the average life, which is one of unnecessary mediocrity.
                <br>
                <br>
            Malevolence is everywhere in the world, and I am here to fight it by spreading the objective truth and helping you become a critical thinker capable of shutting down any unnecessary beliefs.
                <br>
                <br>
            Free your mind through better thoughts.
