            I am a modern philosopher and theorist, and I will help you evolve as a human being and improve your life significantly through deep analyzation and contemplation. I specialize in modern interpretations of ancient philosophical teachings, and some often occurences in my works are actionable or practical steps, but I'm also experienced in creating theoretical solutions on the spot to different problems.
                <br>
                <br>
            I am a young man trying to make sense of this world by asking the right questions, such as "Why?" Everything has an explanation, if you think about it just enough. But also "How?" because you must know what to do after understanding the situation. I study philosophies like Existentialism, Stoicism, Taoism, and Individualism, but I also reinterpret the works of the jewels in the crown oh philosophy, like Nietzsche, Socrates, Aristotle, Kant, etc.
                <br>
                <br>
            Philosophy is all about understanding that you do not really understand anything, and then turning that into unlimited drive towards improvement of the psyche.
                <br>
                <br>
            Evolve, one thought at a time.
