    <h2>The G Sanctuary - Your intellectual realm</h2>
        <p>Are the people around you failures?
        <br>
             <br>
            Were you ever in need of actual knowledge?
          <br>
             <br>
        Did you ever wish to escape the consumption of pointless content?
        <br>
             <br>
      Did you ever want to contemplate life, but didn't have a place to get ideas from?
        <br>
             <br>
        You are on the right path. Life was never meant to be so comfortable and uninteresting. You were put here, on this planet, with a purpose, with a deeper meaning to your existence, something that you must discover in order to reach your full potential.</p>

    <h2>All you must do is ask the right questions</h2>
        <p>Before you can fathom the answers, you need to contemplate the right questions.
            <br>
            <br>
            Your journey towards enlightenment will not be easy, but necessary.
            <br>
            <br>
            The most important thing you must do to embark on this journey is to figure out your priorities. What do you care about, and why? Once you have a path to go down, you are ready to traverse it. You have a bull's-eye to hit, this will be your temporary purpose.
              <br>
            <br>
            As you can imagine, life gets meaningless and bleak when you have nothing to work towards, and thus, you must find a reason for why you are striving for greatness.
                   <br>
            <br>
            The question that philosophy answers is "why?" It is arguably the question that will give you the most insight.</p>

    <h2>The movement of our Sanctuary</h2>
        <p>Any movement or mission can exist independently as merely a concept or an idea.
            <br>
            <br>
            As the leader, I have to take this standing concept and turn it into a walking ecosystem.
            <br>
            <br>
            We won't just walk though, we will run.
              <br>
            <br>
            My mission is to create a place for young philosophy-enthusiasts who not only want to learn more about life and being itself, but also do not want to be judged for it.
                   <br>
            <br>
            I want to make this movement immortal, unable to be taken down by the malevolent forces in the world. Because of the Sanctuary's ties with self-improvement and the resistance to our flawed modern world we are at risk of being cut off. I want to make sure that does not happen.
